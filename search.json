    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nR has quite a rich standard library1, not just to process text, read and work with files, do parallel computing, but also a whole load of statistical functions, including simple neural networks, additive models, survival analysis, and three whole packages for plotting and graphics (graphics for base graphics, grid, and lattice). You can read about all functions in the R’s standard library in the R reference manual.\nThe disadvantage is that while R has a very large standard library, it doesn’t use namespaces. Don’t get me wrong, R has namespaces. Every package has a namespace. And R comes with a bunch of preinstalled packages. But while some specialized statistical functions are in aptly named packages (survival for survival analysis), often a group of unrelated functions are grouped into a single namespace. This presents a significant barrier when it comes to the discoverability of these functions. For instance, consider Python. If you want to work with paths, you know that the functions will be in the os.path module or in the pathlib module, if you want to go for an object-oriented way of handling paths. Additionally, Python’s documentation groups functions according to their usage. Compare this to the R’s reference manual linked above. So if you want to, for instance, know all the functions for text parsing, well good luck. You will have to do a lot of contextualized searches through R’s help system or find a book that does this for you. But while there are books about some popular user-created packages, for instance, the R markdown book, or books that serve as an in-depth exploration of R, such as Advanced R or R packages, there is no in-depth exploration of functions available in base R. This often means that a lot of people will keep reinventing wheels or coming up with complicated solutions requiring one or even multiple packages when there is a more performant one-liner in base R available.\nThe purpose of this series is to explore functions in base R and later perhaps to create a book that will serve as additional documentation of functionalities available in base R.\n\n\nPreinstalled packages\nR comes with a number of preinstalled packages, they are labelled as base and recommended:\n\npackages = installed.packages() |>\n    as.data.frame() |>\n    subset(select=c(\"Package\", \"Priority\")) |>\n    unique() |>\n    split(formula(\"~Priority\"))\nsapply(packages, nrow)\n\n       base recommended \n         14          15 \n\n\nThe 14 base packages are usually the main workhorse of R, while the 15 recommended packages are predominantly of statistical nature. Do not expect the latest, fastest and most feature-full implementation of them, but it also means that if you need something like k-nearest-neighbours, you will find it in the R standard library, which is something that is not typically true for most programming languages.\nBecause of this, the packages have quite a variable number of objects. Here we don’t count only functions, but also included example datasets or pre-set variables. For example T is an alias for TRUE, but you can easily change it such as by setting T=FALSE. So please don’t use T in your scripts, interactive usage only.\nBefore we show the number of objects in each package, we define some helper functions, that way the code will be more readable.\n\n# get object names from a package  \ngetObjects = function(name, all=TRUE){\n    getNamespace(name) |> ls(all.names=all)\n    }\n\n# count the number of objects in a package\ncountObjects = function(name, all=TRUE){\n    getObjects(name, all=all) |> length()\n    }\n\n# apply the countObjects on the `packages` objects defined above\nn_objects = sapply(packages, function(x){\n    x[,1] |> sapply(countObjects) |> sort(decreasing=TRUE)\n    })\nn_objects\n\n$base\n     base     stats      grid   methods     tools     utils     tcltk  compiler \n     1370      1134       872       761       733       529       313       289 \ngrDevices  graphics  parallel   splines    stats4  datasets \n      254       170       145        50        30         3 \n\n$recommended\n    Matrix       nlme       mgcv   survival    lattice       MASS    cluster \n       996        607        495        421        289        232         91 \n codetools       boot    spatial      rpart    foreign       nnet      class \n        89         84         55         51         42         41         29 \nKernSmooth \n        27 \n\n\nFor the packages labelled as base, the base package leads with 1370 objects. The majority of common operations are implemented in this package, from file-system operations, and text-parsing functions, but also mathematical functions like min, mean or set operations. The second largest package is stats, which implements a large number of mathematical and statistical functions. The bread and butter statistical functions like t.test, anova, lm or a general-purpose optimization algorithm optim or functions to work with time-series data are all included in this package. The third largest package is the grid package with 872 objects. grid is one of the alternatives to base graphics, which are implemented in the graphics package. Surprisingly, the graphics package has only 170 objects. Outside of base, stats, tools and utils, the packages starts to be more specialized and also smaller. The packages utils and especially tools are already supposed to be specialized for making packages, but since making packages requires a lot of tooling, and this tooling often has quite a lot of utility, you might occasionally use functions from tools. utils on the other hand has kind of everything, from functions to make packages, download packages, spellchecker, but also functions like help, head, read.table. Classical if you don’t know where to put it, put it into utils.\nIf we look at the packages labelled as recommended, the largest package is the Matrix package, which is the third overall package by size out of preinstalled packages. The Matrix package implements several kinds of sparse matrices and operations on them. This is very important in linear algebra and statistics, as the solution of many statistical models often relies on eigenvalues.\n\nExported functions\nYou might have noticed that I have shown objects using ls(). This way, all objects, whether they are exported or not, are counted. After all, I don’t remember reading about 145 functions in the parallel documentation, so something is off.\nIf we look only at exported objects, the situation would be like this:\n\nn_exported_objects = sapply(packages, function(x){\n    x[,1] |> sapply(\\(y){\n        getNamespaceExports(y) |> length()\n        }) |> sort(decreasing=TRUE)\n    })\nn_exported_objects\n\n$base\n     base     stats   methods     tcltk     utils      grid grDevices     tools \n     1370       456       371       269       221       212       119       119 \n graphics  parallel    stats4   splines  compiler  datasets \n       88        33        28        13         9         0 \n\n$recommended\n    Matrix       mgcv    lattice       nlme       MASS   survival       boot \n       367        182        144        109         78         77         36 \n   spatial    cluster  codetools    foreign      class      rpart KernSmooth \n        25         24         19         17         15         14          7 \n      nnet \n         7 \n\n\nWe can see that the number of objects changes drastically, although the base package remained unaltered. Interestingly, the package datasets doesn’t have a single exported object. This is because datasets consist only of datasets, which are loaded lazily. That is until you use the dataset, it does not occupy the computer memory.\nNow, let’s move to the core of the series, the base package.\n\n\n\nBase R\nWe have explored the number of objects across preinstalled packages, but how many functions are in the base package? The core of base R?\n\n# You can see a similar code in ?Filter examples\nfuns = Filter(is.function, sapply(\n    ls(baseenv(), all.names=TRUE), get, baseenv()\n    ))\nlength(funs)\n\n[1] 1325\n\n\nQuite a lot, 1325 functions. However, a great deal of them are S3 methods. For instance, there are 36 methods just for the S3 generic print.\n\ngrep(\"print.\", baseenv() |> ls(all.names=TRUE),\n    value=TRUE, fixed=TRUE) |> length()\n\n[1] 36\n\n\nThese methods are very important to seamlessly work with different S3 classes. After all, no one wants to call print.foo(x) and print.bar(y), when we can just type print(z). This reduces typing for sure, but also decreases mental overload. In fact, many R users do not know about S3 system, but the dispatch of various methods still work like magic. But enough about S3. For the purpose of this exercise, these are not very interesting. Maybe in the future, we will explore what kind of S3 classes are defined in base R.\nTo filter the S3 methods, we can use isS3method. The only issue is that this function fails for any object starting with a dot. Bummer. Objects starting with a dot are typically considered hidden objects, which should not be used unless you know what you are doing (such as .C or .Call, which are important tools when writing packages).\n\n# this would fail:\n# isS3method(\".C\")\n\nvisible = grep(\"^\\\\.\", names(funs), value=TRUE, invert=TRUE)\n\nnormal = Filter(Negate(isS3method), visible)\nnormal |> length()\n\n[1] 865\n\n\nThis means that to explore all the functions in base package, we need to go through 865 functions.\nThere is a small caveat we have talked about before. ls() does not distinguish whether the functions are or are not exported. Luckily for us, we saw that all the functions in the base package are exported. But just to be sure:\n\n# helper, take a string instead of a function object\nis_function = function(name, env=baseenv()){\n    f = get(name, envir=env)\n    is.function(f)\n    }\n\nnormal = getNamespaceExports(\"base\") |>\n    Filter(f=is_function) |>\n    grep(pattern=\"^\\\\.\", value=TRUE, invert=TRUE) |>\n    Filter(f=Negate(isS3method)) |> sort()\nnormal |> length()\n\n[1] 865\n\n\nUsing slightly different calls, we have arrived at the same number. Great!\n\n\nWhat can you expect next?\nIn the following part of the series, we will start going through the functions alphabetically. Although when we will find a group of similar or related functions, we will describe them together, such as sub and gsub.\nWe will start with the special symbols or operators, make a small segway about different types of functions in R, like .Primitive, .Internal, and we will have to talk a bit more about the generics.\nI hope that you have found this small exploration of the preinstalled packages interesting and that you are as excited as me about continuing in this series.\n\n\nList of functions in the base package\nWe will end with a list of all functions that we will go through in this series:\n\n\nClick to unroll\n\n\n\n  [1] \"-\"                              \":\"                             \n  [3] \"::\"                             \":::\"                           \n  [5]

    "text": "Types of functions\n\nTo understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:\n\nEverything that exists is an object.\nEverything that happens is a function call.\n– John Chambers (author of S, coauthor of R)\n\n\nAs per the quote, everything that happens in R is a function call. Operators are construct similar to functions, but with special syntax or semantics. But you might have realized that not every function is the same and that R has different types of functions.\nFor instance, when you write the name of a standard function, you will print their code. This doesn’t work with operators and other language elements. To operate with them, you need to escape them, either with quotation marks \" or backticks `. Backticks typically work in most occassions. For instance, we can use backticks to print help of +, print the body of - or call * as if it was a function:\n\n?`+` # prints a help-page of +\n`-` # prints the body of -\n\nfunction (e1, e2)  .Primitive(\"-\")\n\n`*`(3,5) # call as if * was a normal function\n\n[1] 15\n\n\nOperators are special kind of functions, but so are other language elements like for, return, or in fact even ( and {. But unlike with operators, calling language elements like a function doesn’t work. We will talk about these language elements in detail some other time.\nThese special functions are called primitives. Primitives are special in many ways. Outside of primitives, all other functions are standard functions that either call R code, or call a compiled C or Fortran code through the interfaces .Internal, .External, .C, .Call or .Fortran.\nTo explore these function types in base, we will define a helper functions. And because there would be a lot of repeated code, we will construct these functions with a function factory.\n\nis_function_type_factory = function(pattern, fixed=TRUE){\n    force(fixed) # force evaluation\n\n    function(x){\n        if(!is.function(x))\n            return(FALSE)\n        \n        body = body(x)\n        if(is.null(body))\n            return(FALSE) # primitives don't have body\n\n        deparse(body) |> grep(pattern=pattern, fixed=fixed) |> any()\n        }\n    }\n\nis.internal = is_function_type_factory(\".Internal\")\nis.external = is_function_type_factory(\".External\")\nis.ccall    = is_function_type_factory(\".C\") # will match .C and .Call\nis.fortran  = is_function_type_factory(\".Fortran\")\n\n# Get all functions from base, we did this before\nfunctions = Filter(is.function, sapply(ls(baseenv()), get, baseenv()))\n\nSo out of 1242, there are 185 primitives, 415 internals, 0 external calls, 3 calls using the .C or .Call interface, 6 calls to Fortran, with the rest being pure R functions.\n\nPrimitives\nPrimitives are special functions that form the core of R language. Normal functions (called closures in R) have a list of arguments called formals, a body, and an enclosing environment (thus called closures).\n\n# formals, body and environment of `is.internal`\nnot_null = Negate(is.null)\nhas_fbe = function(x){c(\n    \"formals\"     = formals(x) |> not_null(),\n    \"body\"        = body(x) |> not_null(),\n    \"environment\" = environment(x) |> not_null()\n    )}\n    \nhas_fbe(is.internal)\n\n    formals        body environment \n       TRUE        TRUE        TRUE \n\n\nCompared to normal functions, primitives do not have any formals, body, or enclosing environment.\n\nhas_fbe(`-`)\n\n    formals        body environment \n      FALSE       FALSE       FALSE \n\n\nThis is why we put an additional check for body(x) |> is.null() in our function factory. So what about the printed body of - that we saw before? It was a fake! R is lying to us here.\n\n`-` # output of this is fake\n\nfunction (e1, e2)  .Primitive(\"-\")\n\n\n\nminus = function(e1, e2) .Primitive(\"-\")\nminus\n\nfunction(e1, e2) .Primitive(\"-\")\n\n\nSee the extra space in the original -? Now watch this. Calling minus(1,2) just prints the original -.\n\nminus(1,2) # just prints the original `-`\n\nfunction (e1, e2)  .Primitive(\"-\")\n\n\nTo get the correct result, we need to call minus()(1,2).\n\nminus()(1,2)\n\n[1] -1\n\n\nThis is because our function returns the .Primitive(\"-\") which then performs the actual call to the - primitive.\nAll the special language elements like for, ( are primitives, so are the functions like .Internal or .Call that communicate with the internal or external libraries. Finally, there is also a performance consideration, many non-special functions are primitives because these call need to be performant.\n\n\nGenerics\nOne reason why I am talking about these types of functions is because of generics. Generics1 are types of functions that when called, they dispatch a function specific to the type of input object. Typically, the type of object is called a class, and the specific function is called a method. This is the core of the S3 object-oriented system. For instance, in most cases you don’t need to worry what kind of object you are working with and call print anyway, which will then dispatch an appropriate method based for the class of the object, such as print.data.frame or print.Date. This makes interactive use quite convenient, but also allows you to write a more generic code. For instance, instead of having to expect every single possible class in your function, you can rest assured that as.character will provide you a reasonable output.\nTypical S3 generic functions would look like this:\n\n\nfunction (x, ...) \nUseMethod(\"print\")\n<bytecode: 0x55926d523a58>\n<environment: namespace:base>\n\n\nJust a single call to UseMethod(\"print\") alternatively UseMethod(\"print\", x) to make the object for which the method will be dispatched (x in this case) explicit. Notice that no other argument parsing is happening there, this is done behind the curtain.\n\n\nGeneric primitives\nPrimitives can be generics as well, even without the use of UseMethod. There are a few ways how this is achieved.\nFirst of all, there are S3 prototype functions in the .GenericsArgsEnv environment. They look like your standard S3 generic function, just a call to UseMethod.\n\nget_objects = function(x){\n    if(is.character(x))\n        x = getNamespace(x)\n\n    sapply(x |> ls(), get, x)\n    }\n\nprimitive_generics = get_objects(.GenericArgsEnv)\nprimitive_generics[1]\n\n$`-`\nfunction (e1, e2) \nUseMethod(\"-\")\n<bytecode: 0x55926ad92ec8>\n<environment: namespace:base>\n\nprimitive_generics |> names() |> head(10)\n\n [1] \"-\"   \"!\"   \"!=\"  \"*\"   \"/\"   \"&\"   \"%/%\" \"%%\"  \"^\"   \"+\"  \n\n\nHowever, I am not sure if they are actually used during calls or are there for other reason, such as documentation. There is a similar environment .ArgsEnv that contains primitives that are not generics.\n\nprimitive_not_generic = get_objects(.ArgsEnv)\n\nprimitive_not_generic[[\"seq_len\"]]\n\nfunction (length.out) \nNULL\n<bytecode: 0x55926ad81b20>\n<environment: namespace:base>\n\n\nThese functions, when executed, just return NULL.\n\nprimitive_not_generic[[\"seq_len\"]](5)\n\nNULL\n\n\nCompare this to a standard call to seq_len\n\nseq_len(5)\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nThis suggests that these functions, likely both .GenericsArgsEnv and .ArgsEnv are not involved in the function dispatch, or if they are, they are involved much later after the .Primitive() call is evaluated.\nThis brings us to the second way how primitives can be generic. But this dispatch is being performed directly in the internal C code using either the DispatchOrEval call or DispatchGeneric. I will stop here and won’t got deeper, because the situation is quickly getting complicated. For instance, despite the manual saying that something called group generics are using the DispatchGeneric, this is not actually the case and this function doesn’t exist in the C code. Instead, many generics are grouped, thus called group, have a complex system of dispatching based utilizing DispatchGroup (instead of DispatchGeneric), switch and integer values likely related to the functions in the src/main/names.c source code.\nYou can see which functions are group generics in two ways, reading the help file for ?groupGeneric (it has no associated object) or by removing non-group generic functions from all primitive generics:\n\nsetdiff(primitive_generics |> names(), .S3PrimitiveGenerics)\n\n [1] \"-\"        \"!\"        \"!=\"       \"*\"        \"/\"        \"&\"       \n [7] \"%/%\"      \"%%\"       \"^\"        \"+\"        \"<\"        \"<=\"      \n[13] \"==\"       \">\"        \">=\"       \"|\"        \"abs\"      \"acos\"    \n[19] \"acosh\"    \"all\"      \"any\"      \"Arg\"      \"asin\"     \"asinh\"   \n[25] \"atan\"     \"atanh\"    \"ceiling\"  \"Conj\"     \"cos\"      \"cosh\"    \n[31] \"cospi\"    \"cummax\"   \"cummin\"   \"cumprod\"  \"cumsum\"   \"digamma\" \n[37] \"exp\"      \"expm1\"    \"floor\"    \"gamma\"    \"Im\"       \"lgamma\"  \n[43] \"log\"      \"log10\"    \"log1p\"    \"log2\"     \"max\"      \"min\"     \n[49] \"Mod\"      \"prod\"     \"range\"    \"Re\"       \"round\"    \"sign\"    \n[55] \"signif\"   \"sin\"      \"sinh\"     \"sinpi\"    \"sqrt\"     \"sum\"     \n[61] \"tan\"      \"tanh\"     \"tanpi\"    \"trigamma\" \"trunc\"   \n\n\nNote that these lists of functions are not generated from the C source code, so there is no way other than reading the C source code to know if a primitive function is generic or not.\n\n\nOperator overloading\nEquations would be quite messy if you had to write a different + for scalars, vector and matrices. In case of operators, this is called operator overloading and can be a dangerous tool if not done carefully.\nThe whole point of operator overloading is that you can have quite complex objects and operate with them in a nice and polite manner as long as the semantics of operators make sense. For instance, the Matrix package defines sparse matrices. Sparse matrices are matrices where the majority of elements are equal to zero. Because of this, it is quite a bit more efficient if they are respresented not as a standard matrix with n*m elements, but with a special representation where you represent only elements that are non-zero. This saves memory and makes some operations faster. At the same time, you want them to behave like standard matrices with operations like addition, multiplication, or subsetting. So in standard S3 way (or S4 in this case), you overload the + operator to dispatch a particular function for addition of two standard matrices, one standard and one sparse, or two sparse matrices. From user perspective, nothing has changed and the operation looks the same M + N regardless of what types the matrices are summed. In languages like Java, which forgeos operator overloading in favour of heavy object-oriented system, you would have to do something of this sort:\n# without operator overloading\nM.add(N)\nYou can see that complex equation might look quite messy due to this. At least Java has function overloading. Without that, you would have to detect the particular type of objects and dispatch an appropriate function by yourself. This is exactly what the R source code written in C has to do.\nNote that this operator overloading does not always work and you can’t easily overload operators for basic types. For instance, some languages like to overload the + operator for the addition of strings, performing string concatenation. This makes sense in some cases, doesn’t in other cases and is another contentious problems, there is a whole discussion about this on the R mailing list.\n\n`+.character` = function(x,y){paste0(x,y)}\n\"foo\" + \"bar\"\n\nError in \"foo\" + \"bar\": non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\nThis is character is a basic type, which do not have a class and thus do not immediatelly work with all primitive generics this way. What matters here is the attribute class that is added to S3 objects. But if you try to explore this attribute with the class(), R will lie to you. You need to use the oldClass() function to see the S3 attribute.\n\nclass(\"foo\") # will lie to you\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\noldClass(\"foo\")\n\nNULL\n\n\nThis overloading will work well for user-defined S3 classes.\n\n`+.foobar` = function(x,y){paste0(x,y)}\nstructure(\"foo\", class = \"foobar\") + structure(\"bar\", class = \"foobar\")\n\n[1] \"foobar\"\n\n\nOr you can define the class explicitelly as a character.\n\n`+.character` = function(x,y){paste0(x,y)}\nstructure(\"foo\", class = \"character\") + structure(\"bar\", class = \"character\")\n\n[1] \"foobar\"\n\n\nBut it is better to not due this.\nAnother way is to overwrite the + function with user-defined function, but don’t do this either. If you think that the + semantics makes sense for strings, just define the %+% operator:\n\n`%+%` = function(x,y){paste0(x,y)}\n\"foo\" %+% \"bar\"\n\n[1] \"foobar\"\n\n\nOne famous case of using the operator + in a special way is to combine graphical elements in the ggplot package.\nOperator overloading is especially useful for the equality operator =, but also for various subsetting operators [ or [[, as well as for the replacement operators [<-. We will talk about this next time.\n\n\nspecial vs builtin\nAnd just for completeness, Primitives and internal functions are also divided into special and builtin.\n\nprimitives = Filter(is.primitive, functions)\nsplit(primitives |> names(), sapply(primitives, typeof)) |>\n    sapply(head, n=10, simplify=FALSE) # sample of bultin and specials\n\n$builtin\n [1] \"-\"   \":\"   \"!\"   \"!=\"  \"(\"   \"*\"   \"/\"   \"&\"   \"%*%\" \"%/%\"\n\n$special\n [1] \"::\"   \":::\"  \"[\"    \"[[\"   \"[[<-\" \"[<-\"  \"{\"    \"@\"    \"@<-\"  \"&&\"  \n\n\nThe difference between them is that builtin functions evaluate all their arguments before being passed to the internal implementation, while special don’t evaluate their arguments. When profiling, builtin functions are also counted as a function calls, while special aren’t. Only a small number of functions are trully special :). And while we can look which primitives are builtin or special, we can’t do so with internal functions. For instance, according to the documentation, cbind is special internal, while grep is builtin internal. But when you to get their type, all you get is a closure.\n\nc(\"cbind\" = typeof(cbind), \"grep\" = typeof(grep))\n\n    cbind      grep \n\"closure\" \"closure\" \n\n\nUnless you want to join the development team of R, you do not need to know about this distinction."

The classic functions in R are closures, but there are special kind of functions called primitives. Most operators are primitives and some primitives can also be generics, which connects them to the S3 dispatch system. This allows operators to be overloaded for user-defined classes, but not for basic types, despite not being typical S3 generics with UseMethod() call."

Again.\n\nWhat can you expect?\nSince I am computational biologists, you can expect some statistics and data science with biological motivations, usually evolutionary biology or bioinformatics.\nRegarding programming things, I will write mostly about R. I am kind of purist so I am one of the few people who prefers base R, including base graphics, so I will try to write a few articles regarding some forgotten treasures there. For example, since base does not divide its functions into namespaces (like Python’s standard library), it is hard to find a complex documentation about all the string-manipulation functions, so many people might not know that functions like trimws() even exists.\nOutside of R, I use also Python, and I finally starter using C/C++, at least in connection with R.\n\n\nWhy wrote blogs? Aren’t there already plenty of them?\nMy memory is terrible and I have a bad tendency of leaving projects unfinished. Blogposts will serve as a good written memory and something that will force me to finish projects to a state where I woldn’t be ashamed of them being public. This goes double for various learning projects. So you see, this blog is not for you, it is for me. But since most of the popular blogs originated in this way, I hope that eventually,\n\n\nMy previous attempts at blogging\nMy previous attempts at blogging didn’t get far. One was named “Mammoths on Mars”, a cool name, something about why developing science to such a degree that we could have mammoths on Mars would be so frigging awesome. But all I got from it was a half-assed post about why testing for phylogenetic signal from data that could arise from an evolutionary process is so complicated. Something that would plague me in the future. Not the half-assed blogpost, but the phylogenetic signal.\nThat was 8 years ago, I was just learning about static site generators which were becoming increasingly popular. Finally, small sites with pure HTML generated from markup format! And since I was using quite a bit Python at that time, I didn’t pick the omnipresent Jekyll, but a Python-based Pelican. But the documentation wasn’t there yet, everyone was talking about templates, but no one really explained what are those in the first places. That was not very beginner friendly.\nMy second attempt came years later, because I really wanted to understand all these templates. Which was a cool learning experience, because you can create a static site generator really easily! You can see the attempt here, only 7 direct dependencies (6, if I remove magrittr) and ~300 lines of code. The site is technically still lives, but I don’t update it often because getting good photos of food is so damn hard. Something about proper light and clean table.\nThe learning experience was cool, I learned a lot about CSS at least. I still dislike the whole experience, which was the reason why for the third time, I picked something pre-backed. And Quarto was recently released. So here we are, after a week fiddling with some internals, parameters, trying to modify the .scss bootstrap theme and finding that it doesn’t do anything. But perfect is the enemy of good, and I really want to write some blogposts and not fiddle with the parameters that much.\nSo here we are, now you know everything. Hope you will find content interesting or at least in some way entertaining."
