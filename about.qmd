## About
I am a computational biologist, bioinformatician, statistician, or just *data scientist* for short.

My main interests are phylogenetic trees and their applications, while traditionally phylogenetic trees are used to estimate the evolutionary relationship of biological species from DNA, I have applied phylogenetic trees to study population dynamics of viruses, animals, cancer cells and languages.

My language of choice is typically R as it is usually the fastest way to read and process data.
But I am proficient with Python, C/C++ and Java as well.

Here you can view my [publications](publications.qmd) or [CV](Moravec_CV.pdf).
